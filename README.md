# Recommendation-Engine

## Task: From a set of items in promotion, recommend users the items based on their past purchases

Let's divide the task into two parts:

1. Where I don't know how well can I evaluate with given dataset. I read the content-based recommendation engines are the most common. So I start with taking Product name similarity between past purchases and items in promotion!

2. In this part, I will create a past transaction count based recommender system.


Part I is complete now!
